# Purpose
This GitHub organization is intended to publicly host source code for
applications and tools developed within the research activity of ICRA.

# Instructions: Who Can Be a Member
Only ICRA staff can be a member of the ICRA org on github.com and release code
in github.com/icra org.

Only members have rights to directly edit code in a github.com/icra repository.
Everyone else will need to submit a pull request. <b>We highly encourage pull
requests from the public</b>. However, please note that not all repositories
are actively maintained.

Members of the public can not attain and do not need collaborator status. You
don't need any special status to submit pull requests or add issues.

# Instructions: Once You Are a Member
To ensure mandatory policies are followed, ICRA org members are not given the
full admin rights you might be used to on your personal github.com accounts.
However, by using teams, team owners, collaborators, and outside collaborators
roles we can make the experience pretty quick and easy.

# Org owners
We currently have one active owner in the org:

- Llu√≠s Bosch (lbosch@icra.cat)

# Repos
We do not give out admin rights on any ICRA Github repos for reasons stated
above. If you want a new repo created or want to edit settings on an existing
repo that require admin access, please contact one of our org owners. Without
admin rights on a repository, you'll still be able to make any code changes
yourself as long as you're a collaborator on that repository or a member of a
team whose participants are collaborators by default.

# Teams
Teams are effective ways of managing repository access privileges for an entire
group of users. Only org owners can create and remove teams, but we now allow
users to be team maintainers. Team maintainers have permissions to add and
remove users to their teams from the population of people who are already ICRA
org members.

# Collaborators
Github also has a role called "collaborator". This is someone who doesn't have
repository ownership or admin rights but can push edits to code directly
without doing a pull request.

If you would like to add a ICRA staff member who is a member of the ICRA org as
a collaborator on a single repository, we still suggest you contact the ICRA
org owners mentioned above about setting up a TEAM for that single repository
instead of adding people one by one. Teams result in less requests (and
therefore waiting) on ICRA org owners for actions. We are sorry you don't have
normal full ownership rights. It is because everyone with write access needs to
be approved ICRA user. If you had normal repository owner right, you could add
any github user.

# Outside Collaborators
Only on a rare case-by-case basis we will allow non-ICRA users to be added to
the org as Outside Collaborators. You can collaborate without this status via
forks, branches, and pull-requests. If you fork a repository, you can make
changes and then submit back a pull-request. A repository maintainer can then
approve those changes. You do not need formal outside-collaborator status for
this!

Please reach out to us if you have any questions.

# Common Requests
Contact our org owners:

- If you need to be added to the ICRA org on github.com

- If you need to create a new team for managing who has access to
make changes on a particular repository or group of repositories.

- If you need to add a new member to an already established team.

## Other ICRA orgs on github.com or gitlab.com or bitbucket
Although ICRA staff are highly encouraged to release open source software on
github.com/icra as that is where most people look so it ensures higher
potential reuse, they are not absolutely required to use that org account. A
common reason code may exist under other orgs is that the software is jointly
maintained by non-ICRA persons or the code was developed by non-ICRA persons
through a ICRA grant.

To encourage discoverability, please use the #ICRA topic tag on any GitHub or
GitLab repositories not under github.com/icra.

## Discovering useful ICRA Open-Source Code via metadata catalogs
There are several ICRA open-source code repositories and as previously
noted, not everything is on github.com/icra. To improve your chance of finding
something useful to you, we suggest you use itlab.icra.cat. This site hosts
metadata descriptions for nearly all of the officially open-sourced code.

ICRA github only shows open-source software. For government-source and patented
software, see itlab.icra.cat.

Please make sure any repos added to github.com/icra are also featured in
itlab.icra.cat!

The information on itlab.icra.cat is presented in a way that leverages
ICRA's technology taxonomy, so if you want to see an aggregate view of ICRA
software categories, it is a good place to visit.

It also includes some older software products that are only available as
downloadable zip files as well as software that must be requested individually
as they might be tied to a patent.

# Questions?
In addition to the emails listed above, you may leave an issue on this
repository. We will use those questions & answers to eventually make a FAQ
section on this page.
